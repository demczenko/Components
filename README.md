## Components library for Newsletters and Landing Pages

# Here you can check is markup you created is valid:
https://validator.w3.org/

# Components created without paddings, added only styles for text with media queries for media query: max-width: 768px
  since containers depends from design you can create it for yourself,
  most common containers added to Containers folder.

# Outlook doesn't accept class="first_class second_class" only class="first_class" is accepted
  so, if you want to add more containers for Title, you have to nest in inside tables.
  Check exmaples of HTML code inside Examples folder.

# Class can be applied only for td or table
  unless you change display property for tag.

# All components aligned by default to center
