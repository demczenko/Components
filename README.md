   there is no too much components, because there is a lot of combinations you can create by yourself just by using created markup

# Check yourself:
   Paste HTML code in order to check is it valid or not: https://validator.w3.org/

# YAGNI
   Before creating new class, think about is it possible to use classes that have been already created to achieve result

# Components created without paddings, added only styles for text with media queries for media query: max-width: 768px
  since containers depends from design you can create it for yourself,
  most common containers added to Containers folder.

# Outlook doesn't accept class="first_class second_class" only class="first_class" is accepted
  so, if you want to add more containers for Title, you have to nest in inside tables.
  Check exmaples of HTML code inside Examples folder.

# Class can be applied only for td or table
  unless you change display property for tag.

# All components aligned by default to center
